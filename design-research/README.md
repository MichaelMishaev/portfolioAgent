## Common Questions

### Q: Which variation should I use if my product doesn't fit exactly?
**A:** Choose the closest match and adapt:
- B2B SaaS → Variation 1 (SaaS)
- Info products/ebooks → Variation 2 (Educational)
- Subscription boxes → Variation 3 (Physical)
- High-touch services → Variation 4 (Premium)

### Q: Can I mix elements from different variations?
**A:** Yes! The variations are guides, not rules. Mix and match based on your needs. For example:
- SaaS product with high price point → Mix Variation 1 + 4
- Physical product with educational aspect → Mix Variation 2 + 3

### Q: Do I need to use all suggested sections?
**A:** No. Start with essentials:
- Hero (required)
- Features (required)
- Social proof (required)
- Pricing (if applicable)
- FAQ (highly recommended)
- CTA (required)

Add other sections based on what your audience needs to convert.

### Q: How long does it take to build?
**A:** Depends on complexity and approach:
- No-code (Framer/Webflow): 2-5 days
- Code from scratch: 7-14 days (following roadmap)
- With existing components: 3-7 days

### Q: What if I can't afford professional photos?
**A:** Alternatives:
- Unsplash/Pexels (free stock photos - be selective)
- Screenshots of your product (often better than stock)
- Simple illustrations (unDraw, Humaaans)
- AI-generated images (Midjourney, DALL-E)
- Focus on excellent typography and layout

### Q: Should I build mobile-first or desktop-first?
**A:** Always mobile-first. Reasons:
