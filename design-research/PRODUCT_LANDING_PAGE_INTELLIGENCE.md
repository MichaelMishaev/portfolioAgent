## Part 6: Modern Design Trends (2024-2025)

### Bento Grid Layouts

**What is it:**
- Asymmetric grid layout
- Varied card sizes (like Japanese bento boxes)
- Mix of content types (images, text, stats, videos)

**Implementation:**
```
CSS Grid approach:
- Define grid with multiple columns (8-12)
- Cards span different column/row counts
- Responsive: Simplify on mobile

Example:
.bento-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(12, 1fr);
  gap: 24px;
}

.card-large {
  grid-column: span 8;
  grid-row: span 2;
}

.card-medium {
  grid-column: span 4;
}

.card-small {
  grid-column: span 4;
  grid-row: span 1;
}
```

**Best for:**
- Feature showcases with varied content
- Highlighting different content types
- Modern SaaS products
- Creating visual interest

**Used by:**
- Notion (feature grids)
- Apple (product comparison)
- Modern portfolios

### 3D Elements & Depth

**Modern 3D Patterns:**

**1. CSS 3D Transforms:**
```css
.card-3d {
  transform: perspective(1000px) rotateY(10deg);
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}

.card-3d:hover {
  transform: perspective(1000px) rotateY(0deg) scale(1.02);
}
```

**2. Layered Depth (Cards):**
```css
.layered-card {
  position: relative;
  box-shadow:
    0 1px 3px rgba(0,0,0,0.12),
    0 8px 16px rgba(0,0,0,0.08),
    0 24px 48px rgba(0,0,0,0.04);
}
```

**3. Parallax Scrolling:**
- Background layers move slower than foreground
- Creates depth illusion
- Subtle implementation (modern approach)

**Used for:**
- Product showcases
- Hero sections
- Feature cards
- Image galleries

### Gradient Meshes

**Modern Gradient Techniques:**

**1. Mesh Gradients (Multi-point):**
```css
.gradient-mesh {
  background:
    radial-gradient(at 20% 30%, #6366F1 0%, transparent 50%),
    radial-gradient(at 80% 70%, #EC4899 0%, transparent 50%),
    radial-gradient(at 50% 50%, #8B5CF6 0%, transparent 50%),
    #FFFFFF;
}
```

**2. Animated Gradients:**
```css
.animated-gradient {
  background: linear-gradient(
    -45deg,
    #667eea, #764ba2, #f093fb, #4facfe
  );
  background-size: 400% 400%;
  animation: gradientShift 15s ease infinite;
}

@keyframes gradientShift {
  0%, 100% { background-position: 0% 50%; }
  50% { background-position: 100% 50%; }
}
```

**Best for:**
- Hero section backgrounds
- Card highlights
- Section dividers
- Brand elements

### Glassmorphism

**Frosted Glass Effect:**
```css
.glass-card {
  background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1);
  backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
  -webkit-backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
  border: 1px solid rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.2);
  border-radius: 16px;
  box-shadow: 0 8px 32px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```

**Usage considerations:**
- Works best over colorful or gradient backgrounds
- Requires backdrop-filter support (check browser compatibility)
- Use subtly for modern aesthetic
- Common in modal overlays, cards, navigation bars

**Best for:**
- Overlay elements
- Navigation bars
- Floating cards
- Modal windows

### Dark Mode

**Implementing Dark Mode:**

**Color Palette Considerations:**
```
Dark mode palette:
- Background: #0A0A0A to #1A1A1A (not pure black #000000)
- Surface: #1E1E1E to #2A2A2A
- Text primary: #E5E5E5 to #FFFFFF
- Text secondary: #A0A0A0 to #B0B0B0
- Borders: #2A2A2A to #3A3A3A

Adjustments:
- Reduce white intensity
- Increase contrast
- Soften bright colors
- Use elevation/shadows differently
```

**CSS Variables Approach:**
```css
:root {
  --bg-primary: #FFFFFF;
  --text-primary: #1A1A1A;
}

[data-theme="dark"] {
  --bg-primary: #0A0A0A;
  --text-primary: #E5E5E5;
}
```

**Toggle Implementation:**
- Respect system preferences: `prefers-color-scheme`
- Provide manual toggle
- Persist user choice (localStorage)
- Smooth transition between modes

### Interactive Product Demos

**Modern Demo Patterns:**

**1. Embedded Live Demo:**
- iframe of actual product
- Limited functionality showcase
- Interactive but controlled
- Example: Figma embeds, Framer demos

**2. Animated Walkthrough:**
- Looping video/animation
- Shows key workflows
- Auto-plays on scroll into view
- No sound, has captions

**3. Click-through Prototype:**
- Hotspots reveal features
- Guided tour format
- Interactive tooltips
- Progress indicator

**4. Interactive Configurator:**
- Real-time customization
- Price updates
- Visual preview
- Used for: Physical products, SaaS plans

**Best Practices:**
- Load on interaction (performance)
- Mobile-optimized
- Clear call-to-action after demo
- Option to skip

### Video Backgrounds

**Implementation Guidelines:**

**Technical specs:**
```html
<video autoplay muted loop playsinline>
  <source src="hero-bg.mp4" type="video/mp4">
</video>
```

**Best practices:**
- Keep short (5-15 seconds loop)
- Compress heavily (under 2MB)
- Use as background, not focal point
- Provide fallback image
- Disable on mobile (use poster image)
- Ensure text remains readable

**Alternative: Subtle animations**
- CSS animations often better performing
- SVG animations for illustrations
- Lottie files for complex animations

### Scroll-Triggered Animations

**Modern Scroll Patterns:**

**1. Intersection Observer API:**
```javascript
const observer = new IntersectionObserver(
  (entries) => {
    entries.forEach(entry => {
      if (entry.isIntersecting) {
        entry.target.classList.add('animate-in');
      }
    });
  },
  { threshold: 0.1 }
);

document.querySelectorAll('.animate-on-scroll').forEach(el => {
  observer.observe(el);
});
```

**2. Parallax scrolling:**
- Background moves slower than content
- Implemented with `transform: translateY()`
- Tied to scroll position
- Keep subtle (performance impact)

**3. Stagger animations:**
- Children animate in sequence
- Delay each by 50-100ms
- Creates professional flow
- CSS: `animation-delay` with nth-child

**Popular libraries:**
- GSAP ScrollTrigger
- AOS (Animate on Scroll)
- Framer Motion
- React Spring

**Best practices:**
- Don't overuse
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`
- Keep performant (CSS transforms only)
- Test on mobile
